# Columns:
# 0: place (string), 1: count1 (int), 2: count2 (int), 3: count3 (int)

# 5. Joining (16 points): The following program construct a new dataframe out of 'df' with a much smaller size.

df2 = df.select("word", "year").distinct().limit(100);
df2.createOrReplaceTempView('gbooks2')

# Now we are going to perform a JOIN operation on 'df2'. Do a self-join on 'df2' in lines with the same #'count1' values and see how many lines this JOIN could produce. Answer this question via Spark SQL API

# Spark SQL API

# output: 162
